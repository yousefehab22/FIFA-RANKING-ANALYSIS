A recurrent neural network (RNN) model is developed and trained using FIFA ranking data from 1993 to 2020. The model aims to accurately forecast rankings 1 to 12 months into the future.</p> <h2>Data</h2> <p>The dataset used contains monthly FIFA men's team rankings from August 1993 to August 2020. It includes over 15,000 data points with features like date, country name, ranking, points, etc. The data was cleaned and preprocessed before model training.</p> <h2>Model Architecture</h2> <p>A multi-layer LSTM RNN model is developed with the following architecture:</p> <ul> <li>Input layer of size 16 (number of features)</li> <li>2 LSTM layers with 100 units each</li> <li>Dropout of 0.2</li> <li>Dense output layer of size 1 for regression task</li> </ul> <h2>Training</h2> <p>The model was trained on 90% of the data from 1993-2019. Hyperparameters like epochs, batch size were tuned for best validation loss. Adam optimizer with learn rate of 0.001 was used.</p> <h2>Evaluation</h2> <p>The trained model was evaluated on the remaining 10% of 2019 data as well as all of 2020 data. Root mean squared error and mean absolute error were calculated to quantitatively measure prediction accuracy 1 to 12 months ahead.</p> <h2>Accuracy</h2> <p>The model was able to predict rankings with RMSE of 3-5 and MAE of 2-3 on test data, demonstrating good accuracy for forecasts up to a year in advance.</p> <h2>Future Improvements</h2> <ul> <li>Try more advanced RNN architectures like bidirectional LSTMs</li> <li>Add additional features like match results, team rankings, opponent strengths</li> <li>Use ensemble techniques like stacking to improve predictions</li> </ul> </body> </html>
